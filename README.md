transfer.py
==========

**Python script for transfer.sh**
---------------------------------
Transfer.sh (https://transfer.sh) is a website that provides easy file sharing from command line.

Transfer.sh requires that we take advantage of curl command functionality to allow upload and download of files,
while transfer.sh will store the files you need to move around for a short time (14 days)

I found out about transfer.sh website and really like the simplicity of using command line and be able 
to upload files temporarily in order to move them around easily. 
I wrote this python script to be able to track the files that I have uploaded while they are still 
available in transfer.sh.

Pre-Requisites

There are of course a few items that are required in your system in oder to be able to 
run transfer.py.
* As of now the script only support posix operating systems(Linux, Unix, OSX, etc)
* The script was written for Python3 (so make sure you have it in your system)
* I requires the docopt and json libraries to be install for python 3

  whereit keeps the information on the files you have uploaded form that computer to transfer.sh
